# Restful principles based on best practices #
Following principles are based on the references such as Github API and Twitter API in addition to blogs
collecting the best practices. See references at bottom of this list.

# Table of contents
- [1. Use nouns but not verbs](#1-use-nouns-but-not-verbs)
- [2. Use plural nouns](#2-use-plural-nouns)
- [3. GET method and query parameters should not alter the state](#3-get-method-and-query-parameters-should-not-alter-the-state)
- [4. Relations](#4-relations)
- [5. Versioning](#5-versioning)

# 1. Use nouns but not verbs
* GET '/api/notes' to `query` function
* GET '/api/notes/:id' to `detail` function
* POST '/api/notes' to `insert` function
* DELETE '/api/notes/:id' to `remove` function
* PATCH '/api/notes/:id' to `update` function

# 2. Use plural nouns
Do not mix up singular and plural nouns. Keep it simple and use only plural nouns for all resources.
	
	/cars instead of /car
	/users instead of /user
	/products instead of /product
	/settings instead of /setting

# 3. GET method and query parameters should not alter the state
Use `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE` HTTP verbs instead of the GET verb to alter the state.

Do not use GET for state changes:

	GET /users/711?activate or
	GET /users/711/activate

# 4. Relations
If a resource is related to another resource use subresources.

	GET /cars/711/drivers/ Returns a list of drivers for car 711
	GET /cars/711/drivers/4 Returns driver #4 for car 711
 
# 5. Versioning

# 6. Documentation

# 7. Provide filtering, sorting, field selection and paging for collections
## Filtering:
Use a unique query parameter for all fields or a query language for filtering.

	GET /notes?q={"title":"Welcome to the first page"} #returns a list of notes with this string phrase

## Sorting:
Allow ascending and descending sorting over multiple fields.

	GET /notes?sort=-title #sort a notes resource by title descending
	
## Field selection
Mobile clients display just a few attributes in a list. They donâ€™t need all attributes of a resource. 
Give the API consumer the ability to choose returned fields. This will also reduce the network traffic 
and speed up the usage of the API.

	GET /notes?select=date #select only date the field of a notes resource
	
## Paging
### Paging parameters
Use `pageSize` and `page` to restrict number of resources returned. Page size should have an default value
and should not be set to unlimited number because of performance issues. First page is page=0.

	GET /notes?pageSize=10&page=2 #returns notes 21-30

### HTTP Header link
Links to the next or previous page should be provided in the 
[HTTP header link](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) as well. 
It is important to follow this link header values instead of constructing your own URLs.

	link:
	<http://example.com/notes?p=0>; rel="first",
	<http://example.com/notes?p=1>; rel="prev",
	<http://example.com/notes/?p=3>; rel="next"
	<http://example.com/notes/?p=3>; rel="last"

### Total number of entries
To send the total entries back to the user use the custom HTTP header: `X-Total-Count`.

# 8. Return a resource representation in PATCH and POST

# 9. Use HATEOAS
**H**ypermedia **a**s **t**he **E**ngine **o**f **A**pplication **S**tate is a principle that hypertext links should be used to create a better 
navigation through the API.
```javascript
{
  "id": 711,
  "manufacturer": "bmw",
  "model": "X5",
  "seats": 5,
  "drivers": [
   {
    "id": "23",
    "name": "Stefan Jauker",
    "links": [
     {
     "rel": "self",
     "href": "/api/v1/drivers/23"
    }
   ]
  }
 ]
}
```
# 10. Handle Errors with HTTP status codes
## Use HTTP status codes
## Use error payloads

# 11. Use HTTP headers for serialization formats
Both, client and server, need to know which format is used for the communication. 
The format has to be specified in the HTTP-Header.

**Content-Type** defines the request format.

**Accept** defines a list of acceptable response formats.

# 12. Use camelCase for field names

# 13. Ensure gzip is supported

# 14. Rate limiting
To prevent abuse, it is standard practice to add some sort of rate limiting to an API. 
[RFC 6585](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585) introduced a HTTP status code 
[429 Too Many Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4) to accommodate this.

At a minimum, include the following headers (using 
[Twitter's naming conventions](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting) and 
[Githup API](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/)as headers typically don't 
have mid-word capitalization):

* `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` - The number of allowed requests in the current period
* `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` - The number of remaining requests in the current period
* `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` - The number of seconds left in the current period
